🌸 Quote Generator — A Hug in Code

> “Sometimes, we all need a little reminder — that we're not alone, and it's going to be okay.”



The Quote Generator is more than just a JavaScript project — it's a personal piece of peace, designed during a quiet moment of sadness. Made with love, this app gently offers random motivational quotes, wrapped in an aesthetically soft, calming layout — just like a warm hug. 🤍
